    <p>Born in 1963 in Vadakara, Kerala, India, Mr. K P Basheer was raised with strong business values inherited from his father. After completing his education, he ventured to Bahrain in 1983, where he established Gift Palace, later expanding into wholesale trading. In 1998, Mr. Basheer made a pivotal decision to relocate to Dubai, founding GEEPAS, a brand that defied multinational dominance in the market.</p>

    <p>Facing challenges from established brands, GEEPAS thrived with a unique business model, offering affordable yet quality products. Mr. Basheer's vision and commitment led to GEEPAS becoming a household name synonymous with reliability and affordability.</p>

His leadership saw exponential growth, even during economic downturns, with the group expanding globally and employing over 35,000 professionals worldwide.</p>

    <p>Today, the group pioneers new concepts in e-commerce, food, fashion, and value retail with plans for further expansion across the MENA region and beyond. Nesto, the flagship retail chain of Western International Group, delivers cherished shopping experiences across markets in the GCC and India, while Mark & Save, the group's discount superstore, aims for 200 store launches over the next 3 years.</p>

    <p>Grateful for the support of the UAE leadership, Mr. Basheer remains humble and exemplifies resilience, innovation, and a commitment to excellence in business, reflecting the group's ethos and vision for success.</p>

    <h4>Leadership & Business Philosophy</h4>
    <p>Honed over four decades in business, Mr. Basheer's business and management approach is deeply rooted in several core principles that have become the bedrock of Western International Groupâ€™s corporate culture as the organization strives for excellence in all its endeavors.</p>
